<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="i-have-been-busy-with-something-for-work-lately">I have been busy with something for work lately…</h2>
<p>Alright so this a bit of a crazy idea.</p>
<p>At work, these past few weeks, when I had the time, I had this side project, whereby I would try to create a model to classify texts in two categories, like “important vs not-important”. Sounded easy enough upfront, in my mind even a <strong>basic Naïve-Bayes (i.e.&nbsp;supervised learning) classifier would easily do the trick</strong>…</p>
<p><strong>How wrong I was</strong>. After some testing, and several more or less complex algorithms all failing with similarly low accuracy (and that was enough for me, I needed not check other metrics)… I dug further, and I finally found some texts that were repeated across both classes. That is, yes: same identical complete text but present in the two classes. You know what they say: “Garbage-in, Garbage-out”. Now, <strong>to be fair, there was a reason for it</strong>, through <strong>no fault of the original/historical manual tagging</strong>! The thing just wasn’t originally meant to be used as a training dataset for a future Supervised Learning classifier, and the tags used were in fact a mess - from the perspective of this exercise, although they made sense in their original context. Anyhow…</p>
<p>So <strong>we went back and started a fresh new (manual) classification system</strong> (well, my colleagues did) and <strong>right away</strong> the newly classified data allowed for a <strong>10% accuracy increase</strong> across all models/algorithms tested with it as training/testing set. And that, with a much smaller new dataset. So we were onto something, for sure.</p>
<p>And yet, none of the algorithms still provided very good results. Part of the issue is, some of the texts in both classes are <strong>very</strong> similar. Me, I’d have a hard time deciding for some of the entries which class should apply (I’ve tried, and failed, so maybe I shouldn’t ask my machine to do something I can’t manually do myself on a small sample…).</p>
<p>As a note, part of that classification exercise is in fact a bit of an art, maybe, and somewhat <strong>tacit</strong> information is required, experience: Hard to explain, and hence hard to manually write down in rules, <strong>which is why the ML approach was suggested in the first place</strong> (otherwise, simple rules could have worked?).</p>
<p>An example: My company works in Healthcare, so mentions of hospitals and patients would be an easy give-away, compared to news about say fashion, or transportation…. But most of it isn’t as clear-cut…</p>
</section>
<section id="rlcs-for-text-then" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="rlcs-for-text-then">RLCS for text, then?</h2>
<p>As we (you, my reader, and myself) have learnt over the past few months, the RLCS implementation has a few shortcomings, and today two of them are of particular interest:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The binary input string format issue is going to be a bother</p></li>
<li><p>The very <strong>high importance, for performance, of the length</strong> of said binary input strings, is another one.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Why so?</p>
<p>Well, <strong>free text is not great to transform to binary strings</strong>. I am however willing to do a simplified test: Generate a TF-IDF (done) of the input texts, keep the main keywords, say top… 100 (rather easy), and instead of real numbers, just encode in binary (i.e.&nbsp;a keyword (stemmed and all, cleaned up) appears or doesn’t, for a particular entry of text). That seems <strong>simple enough</strong>: just “grep” over new text and look for a particular keyword, and that encodes one variable, and repeat with all 100 top keywords. Here you go: Binary string of length 100.</p>
<p>But <strong>100 variables</strong> from a TD-IDF is a <strong>brutal</strong> simplification, when the original matrix might well have 3 or 4 <strong>thousand</strong> distinct stemmed-keywords… That’s a big information loss right there. (And I don’t mean to go the way of PCA and such, <strong>I could, but explainability of the results would be quite impacted</strong>, and so no, not today).</p>
<p>Also, going <strong>from real number to binary true/false is another brutal information loss</strong>. More on this one in a moment.</p>
<p>“100” here is just an idea, but come to think of it, I don’t think I can do much more than, say, 300? That is, without crawling to a halt in terms of processing time. I haven’t tried yet, and with the improvements in speed of a few weeks back, who knows… :D</p>
</section>
<section id="testing-the-idea" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="testing-the-idea">Testing the idea</h2>
<p>So I am willing to work on this approach starting this very weekend. (Maybe that will spill over the beginning of next week, but since this is actually “for work”, well, I don’t see an issue with merging my personal- and work-time for a few days here…)</p>
<p>What I am hoping is, I can get some machine-provided rules to <strong>help</strong> with the automated classification of future texts. The texts at work are about Cybersecurity news (but that detail is not in fact important for this post). I just want to create something that will <strong>help</strong> the analysts in choosing what to worry about and what they can safely discard as noise/irrelevant pieces of news.</p>
<p>One important aspect here will be the False-Positive vs False-Negative ratio, among other things. I am also worried about data-drift, as one keyword in the overall exercise is “news”, which, you know, change over time.</p>
<p>But heck, this is all future issues, the first thing is to get a good enough classifier, that we shall later refine.</p>
<p>And <strong>if I make the RLCS package (code) part of the final solution</strong>, if I actually show it can be useful for such a practical, real-world scenario, well… But <strong>that’s a big “if”</strong>.</p>
</section>
<section id="my-own-rosetta-stone" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="my-own-rosetta-stone">My own Rosetta Stone</h2>
<p>Actually, this is one excuse for this entry:</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="rosetta_stone_tuned.png" class="img-fluid figure-img" width="400"></p>
<figcaption>a rosetta stone to use with RLCS</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>I have been meaning to do something about the limitation with the binary input strings issue. But instead of changing the code of the RLCS (for now), <strong>what if instead</strong> I facilitated the future data scientists’ efforts by offering a sort of <strong>translation engine</strong>?</p>
<p>I could in fact create a function that:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>takes a data frame as input (say), or even a matrix.</p></li>
<li><p>encodes factors or texts into variables with binary strings. Length of said variables would depend on the number of distinct values (i.e.&nbsp;levels of factors). Now that won’t work for pure free text, but it just might for short tags received as text columns in the DF.</p></li>
<li><p>and using the function I demonstrated for the Iris dataset a few weeks back, I can “easily” encode real numbers into “bins” that I can then encode with binary strings. See <a href="http://localhost:3578/posts/2025-03-30_Small_Addition_RLCS/">this entry</a> about how that could work.</p></li>
<li><p>Keep track of the above transformations and offer a “translator” to translate back the resulting rules learnt by the RLCS into the original format, or a readable version of it anyway.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>I call this the Rosetta Stone</strong> for (what I believe are) obvious reasons.</p>
<p>And I <strong>shall create such a Rosetta Stone function (or maybe an object?) as part of the RLCS package, for sure. That should help with adoption</strong>, or so I would hope.</p>
<p>But maybe <strong>for now I focus on the simpler application</strong>. Direct binary encoding of top TF-IDF keywords, a simple binary present-or-not encoding. Simplistic, maybe too much so, but until I try… I won’t know, now will I?</p>
</section>
<section id="conclusions" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>Naïve-Bayes, SVM, Random-Forest, Lasso, heck even DNN, you name it: If the data is not good, and two classes are in fact not “somewhat clearly” separable (or no generalized rule will stand), then no amount of processing will create great models. I have tried (thanks to suggestion by other colleagues) more modern approaches, such as full-text embeddings (maybe my approach was simplistic: I used word2vec, with say 200 dimensions, and then averaged full entries vectors… obtaining simple encodings of texts in 200-dimensional vectors, each text one point… It actually kind’a worked, but still wasn’t great, and aside from clustering approaches, well, results would be harder to explain… Anyhow, I digress: This wasn’t a solution. Yet :D)</p>
<p>That said, <strong>maybe</strong> a subset of <strong>good, understandable rules,</strong> while <strong>not always</strong> useful, can <strong>make a dent</strong> into the problem. And that’s what I’m <strong>hoping</strong> the application of RLCS to this text classification problem might offer: Find us some rules that will classify perfectly <strong>some</strong> of the new texts, so that an analyst can skip reading through them, and maybe move on to other news.</p>
<p><strong>Then</strong>, where the rule-set won’t actually work, the RLCS output will hopefully tell you it’s <strong>not confident</strong> (mixed subset of recommended classes) in the proposed classification, and so <strong>as an analyst you can go back to other approaches</strong> (or say manually review, tag, and save for future improvements), but <strong>at least you will have received help for the clear-cut cases</strong>, in reviewing <strong>some</strong> of the news pieces.</p>
<p>So I am hoping I can at the very least <strong>reduce the size of the problem</strong>, in the <strong>short term</strong>. And I do believe, this is something the RLCS can help with :)</p>
