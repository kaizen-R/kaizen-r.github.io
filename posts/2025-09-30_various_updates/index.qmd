## This last few days were... Different

So, for one: Last weekend I basically spent it unlocking a very-well locked laptop. More precisely, a BitLocker protected Windows would refuse to boot. The HP partition to re-install wouldn't even see the ciphered partition. Neither would a Windows Repair or Windows Install USB.

Finally, a Live-Ubuntu pendrive gave me hopes when I saw the disk using

```         
fdisk -l
```

But then, that was only the beginning. Next, I needed the BitLocker recovery password. I had to wait for a few weeks for the (anonymous, for this post) user to give it to me.

When I got it at last, I spent the weekend trying to open the ciphered partition.

## Remember: Backup, Backup and... Backup

Yep. That's like the first 3 rules of Cybersecurity.

And I **should** have done that in the first place: Do a "dd" of that disk the moment I saw it. But then I needed a spare 1TB disk which... I didn't have. Fair enough: I could have bought one. I should have. I didn't.

And so, when the time came to actually try to access the data, every single step of the way was stressful: One wrong move anywhere, I could corrupt the thing. And then forget about recovering data.

Well, that's why I took my sweet time with it. Long hours went into this "task". So many more that I care to admit. Oh well.

It's done, we got the data back.

### Side note

Almost all of it was already in a separate backup, so the effort was worth a measly few files... But that I didn't know upfront... Plus, it's been a good exercise.

I realized after the fact, Sunday afternoon, it had been about 20 years I hadn't "dug" so deep into SysAdmin stuff.

Also: **Praise to "dislocker"**. Really great stuff.

And also: Ubuntu wouldn't cut it (almost! but then no); neither did SystemRescue. Kali was the distro that would have the up-to-date-enough version of dislocker in the end. Without which, there was no opening the f\$\*#" disk... (A few hours lost right there...)

## So what's next?

Well, a few other things happened.

I have a presentation ready... To do a 1h+ stint. It turns out, I will only get 15'. I should have asked earlier, this one is on me.

So first, I need to make my RLCS presentation comprehensible and useful for a 15' (tops!) session. Which, for who knows me, is difficult. I have a much easier time talking more, than I have talking less!

"It's long because I didn't have the time to make it shorter" is a saying (no idea of the source). It applies, here. I have a month ahead of me to squeeze the valuable stuff of the RLCS package into a 10 to 15' presentation. Alright, it's not that bad, feasible.

And then, for no reason whatsoever, I got reminded (thanks random LinkedIn posts) about the ARC-AGI1 challenge. And it got my head spinning.

## ARC-AGI as a new Blog topic

Well, it's ambitious indeed. But heck, why not? So it's official, I'll look into it. Even if I finally decide I can't barely start tackling the challenge, I'm somehow certain I will learn stuff along the way.

Heck, a few initial outcomes of simply *thinking* about it:

-   After a few hours giving it some thought, it's clear almost none of what I have done thus far will help me with this challenge. (Link in resources, if you don't know it).

-   I think one key aspect of this "few shots learning" approach, after trying some examples myself, is about finding what changes. So I'm thinking XOR right there. But XOR what?

-   I think I need to somehow... Represent knowledge? IDK! Oh, and this reminisces of course some "Knowledge Graphs" concepts, which I was not a big fan of, but maybe now I'll give them a thought.

-   Talking about graphs!

    -   One aspect of the ARC AGI thing that isn't helpful is... It's a rather "visual" challenge, and I'm more of a tabular-data or, sometimes, text-only-data person. So this is a challenge a bit. But I already learnt I can do "kernels" and understand them a bit...

    -   Well, I found something else that is interesting for this challenge, **and uses graphs!** It's an algorithm called "Connected Components Labelling" and I found it marvelous, well because it uses graphs :)

-   I won't go into details, but it turns out it's just so **very similar** in my mind to the Bongard problems (which I discovered in the "bible" GEB...)

## Various notes

I have **yet** to finish Hofstadter's "GÃ¶del, Escher, Bach". I just don't fathom reading it with anything less than 100% of attention, and no more than one chapter at a time. And I read quite a few books at the same time, and so this one is taking me forever! But I **definitely** intend to finish it in due time.

Oh, and yes, there is an ARC AGI2. But let's not even get there yet. It's not the goal.

## Conclusion

For my anonymous person, good results: We got her data back.

For me? Not so tangibly-productive a week, I guess, but I have had time to think about innovation (oh, that's right: I'm also reading "The Idea Factory", about Bell Labs, by J. Gertner, and enjoying it inmensely, although here again, I'm taking my sweet time, maybe getting a couple of chapters out of the way each week... Still!). Right, so, thinking about ARC AGI, innovation, but also about Cybersecurity, as I have drifted a bit away from my "core topic" by following my various curiosities...

Sometimes, not doing, thinking, is good too.
