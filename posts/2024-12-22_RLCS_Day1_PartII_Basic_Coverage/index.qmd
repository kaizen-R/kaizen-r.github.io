# Just a quick update

## It's sunday...

So I had a bit of time. And I chose to use it to keep going a bit. I moved a couple of things, created a few more supporting functions, modified them somewhat, and added the covering part.

Covering needs to happen when for a given training instance (state, class), there is no match in the **correct set**.

**Correct set is the subset of the Matching set for which, on top of the condition matching, the predicted class/action is also correct.**

And well, it's working:

## Conclusion

Next up is "Rule Discovery", whereby, in Michigan-style LCS, a **GA-like** process will take place to **create offspring from two parents taken in the Correct set**.

That will include **cross-over** (in one way or another) and **mutation** (with a preset pressure/probability). With these, on top of coverage, the LCS will hence create **new valid rules,** that **will become part of the population**, to be evaluated on further training instances.

Other parts of the algorithm – meant to contain the population size – will come later. :)
