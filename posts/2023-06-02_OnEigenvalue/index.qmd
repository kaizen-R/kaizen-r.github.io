## More Eigenvalues value

A quick post to make a note about how often I come across the concept of Eigenvalues now.

In summary, so far I have seen at some point or another that you can use them to (at least):

-   Find PCA components (using the Covariance matrix derived from a Multivariate dataset, because in there the eigenvectors are orthogonal).

-   Find the “eigenvector centrality” of nodes in a network graph

-   Solve systems of related differential equations

And that’s it. There’s more of course. But… That’s mostly a note to myself. Matrices and linear algebra can be very useful.
