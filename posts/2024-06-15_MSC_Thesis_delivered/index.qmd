## From the old blog

In the old blog, I did comment/discuss a **lot** about the latest Master Thesis I was working on.

Instead of reproducing every single entry, I thought I'd just link to the resulting paper, and reproduce the last entry on the topic.

Here goes:

And the last Blog entry said...

## Old entry

"Itâ€™s done.

The thesis was successfully defended.

It has been a great almost 3 years. Iâ€™ve learnt many things, re-discovered others. It has opened up new topics to dive in.

And now comes a period I should use to slow down a bit, as the last few weeks have been a bit intense.

But I very much liked this Master and if anything, I would take more courses of it if I couldâ€¦

Anyhow. This is the end of a 3 years studies period, and I will start thinking more seriously about whatâ€™s next. In a few weeks.

In the meantime, I will read, I have lots of reading in the backlog. (Already started ðŸ˜Œ)"
