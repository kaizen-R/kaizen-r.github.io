 switch device computer network connects devices together. multiple data cables plugged switch enable communication different networked devices. switches manage flow data across network transmitting received network packet one devices packet intended. networked device connected switch can identified network address , allowing switch direct flow traffic maximizing security efficiency network.
 switch intelligent ethernet hub , simply retransmits packets every port hub except port packet received, unable distinguish different recipients, achieving overall lower network efficiency.
 ethernet switch operates data link layer (layer  ) osi model create separate collision domain switch port. device connected switch port can transfer data ports time transmissions will interfere.       broadcasts still forwarded connected devices switch, newly formed network segment continues broadcast domain . switches may also operate higher layers osi model, including network layer above. switch also operates higher layers known multilayer switch .
 segmentation involves use switch split larger collision domain smaller ones order reduce collision probability improve overall network throughput. extreme case (i . micro-segmentation), device directly connected switch port dedicated device. contrast ethernet hub, separate collision domain switch port. allows computers dedicated bandwidth point-to-point connections network also run full-duplex mode. full-duplex mode one transmitter one receiver per collision domain, making collisions impossible.
 network switch plays integral role modern ethernet local area networks (lans). mid-to-large-sized lans contain number linked managed switches. small office/home office (soho) applications typically use single switch, all-purpose device residential gateway access small office/home broadband services dsl  cable internet . cases, end-user device contains router components interface particular physical broadband technology.
 many switches pluggable modules, small form-factor pluggable (sfp) modules. modules often contain transceiver connects switch physical medium, fiber optic cable.               modules preceded medium attachment units connected via attachment unit interfaces switches               evolved time first modules gigabit interface converters , followed xenpak modules, sfp modules, xfp transceivers ,
sfp+ modules, qsfp,        qsfp-dd,        osfp        modules. pluggable modules also used transmitting video broadcast applications.

 switches commonly used network connection point hosts edge network. hierarchical internetworking model similar network architectures, switches also used deeper network provide connections switches edge.
 switches intended commercial use, built-in modular interfaces make possible connect different types networks, including ethernet, fibre channel , rapidio , atm , itu-t    . connectivity can layers mentioned. layer-2 functionality adequate bandwidth-shifting within one technology, interconnecting technologies ethernet token ring performed easily layer via routing.        devices interconnect layer  traditionally called routers .      
 need great deal analysis network performance security, switches may connected wan routers places analytic modules. vendors provide firewall ,               network intrusion detection ,        performance analysis modules can plug switch ports. functions may combined modules.      
 port mirroring , switch can create mirror image data can external device, intrusion detection systems packet sniffers .
 modern switch may implement power ethernet (poe), avoids need attached devices, voip phone  wireless access point , separate power supply. since switches can redundant power circuits connected uninterruptible power supplies , connected device can continue operating even regular office power fails.

 bridging    edit   
   modular network switch three network modules (a total ethernet ports) one power supply
   five-port layer-2 switch without management functionality
 modern commercial switches primarily use ethernet interfaces. core function ethernet switch provide multiple ports layer-2 bridging. layer-1 functionality required switches support higher layers. many switches also perform operations layers. device capable bridging known multilayer switch.
 layer network device multiport device uses hardware addresses ( mac addresses ) process forward data data link layer (layer ).
 switch operating network bridge may interconnect otherwise separate layer networks. bridge learns mac address connected device, storing data table maps mac addresses ports. table often implemented using high-speed content-addressable memory (cam), vendors refer mac address table cam table.
 bridges also buffer incoming packet adapt transmission speed outgoing port. specialized applications, storage area networks, input output interfaces bandwidth, always case general lan applications. lans, switch used end-user access typically concentrates lower bandwidth uplinks higher bandwidth.
 ethernet header start frame contains information required make forwarding decision, high-performance switches can begin forwarding frame destination whilst still receiving frame payload sender. cut-through switching can significantly reduce latency switch.
 interconnects switches may regulated using spanning tree protocol (stp) disables forwarding links resulting local area network tree without switching loops . contrast routers, spanning tree bridges must topologies one active path two points. shortest path bridging trill (transparent interconnection lots links) layer alternatives stp allow paths active multiple equal cost paths.
