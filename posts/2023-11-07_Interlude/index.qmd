## I said I wouldn’t code… and I didn’t.

But then… I finished this book, and I liked it, and I thought I would recommend it.

I don’t know how something not at the level of “introduction” would look like, but this was just sooo in line with my MSc dissertation… Funny I hadn’t read it before!

Also, code in there is in Python, I’m sure many would appreciate that.

So there. A book recommendation.
